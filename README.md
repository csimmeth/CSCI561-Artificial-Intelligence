## Reversi Solver
The [Reversi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi) solver provides a depth-bound optimal next move for any given game board. It implements the [Alpha Beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning) algorithm, and uses predefined positional weights to calculate this move.

## Wedding Planner
The wedding planner is an implementation of the [DPLL Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPLL_algorithm) used to create constraint-bound seating arrangements for wedding guests.

## Decision Network Optimizer
The optimizer parses a text encoding of a Bayesian network with additional utility and decision nodes. It calculates joint, marginal, or conditional probabilities of nodes via enumeration, and uses these probabilities to compute expected utility and optimum decision making.
